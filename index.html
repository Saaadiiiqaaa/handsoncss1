    <h2 ><i>What is CSS?</i></h2>
    <ol style="color:brown">
        <li>CSS Stands for Cascading Style sheet</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML Elements are to be displayed on paper,screen or in the other media </li>
        <li><strike>CSS is not nessesary </strike>.<mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark> it can change the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li id="underline">External stylesheets are stored in CSS file.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added in HTML documents in 3 ways</h2>
    <ul class="types" >
        <li>inline- by using style attribute inside html Elements</li>
        <li>internal- by using style element inside head section</li>
        <li>External- by using link  element to link a external css file</li>
        <li>the most common way to add css is to ,to keep the styles in external css file.however <mark>in this tutorial we will
            use inline and internal styles</mark>,because this is easier to demonstrate and easier to you to try it yourself
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>when comparing css class vs id ,the difference is that class file applies style to multiple Elements.ID,on the otherhand
        applies style to one unique element,ID is also special in that you can use a special url to link directly to an element
        which is used by java script.
    </p>
    <p>in CSS, selectors are used to target specific element or range of elements on the webpage .once an element ha been targeted
        a style or set of style can be applied to the elements
    </p>
    <p>
        there should be wide range of selector available .two of most commly used are class and ID.both are used to target elements
        to which style should be applied.
